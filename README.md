# Technical test for by Touche

>The kataâ€™s statement is the following:

> Write a program that loads a set of employee records from a flat file,
> and sends a greetings email to all employees whose birthday is today.
>The flat file is a sequence of records, separated by newlines. These
are the first few lines:

```csv
last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
```

> The greetings email contains the following text:
> ```html
> Subject: Happy birthday!
> Happy birthday, dear John!
>```

> The goal of this exercise is to come up with a solution that is:
> - Testable: We should be able to test the internal application logic with no need to ever send a real email.
> - Flexible: we anticipate that the data source in the future could change from a flat file to a relational database, or perhaps a web service. We also anticipate that the email service could soon be replaced with a service that sends greetings through Facebook or some other social network.
> - Well-designed: separate clearly the business logic from the infrastructure.

> **Note1**: the email sender can be a mock. Is not required to be able to send emails for real.\
> **Note2**: do not forget ensure everything is properly tested.

> Thanks and good luck!
